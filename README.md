##Website for [PETMON] ( https://github.com/Ennoster/PETMON)

PETMON is in many ways, an inevitable extension of the growing “Internet of Things” or "IoT", a term nowadays commonly used to describe 
an increasing digital connectivity through which everyday items—and now pets—can be accessed, monitored, and even controlled via the Internet.

PETMON can notify owners of their pet's physical activity, location, environmental information and basic health stats. With so much 
information in the owner's hands, the owner can now not only keep track of their pet's whereabouts but also keep a watch on the step count, 
pulse rate, body and environmental temperature and most importantly set up GPS boundaries. 

## Features

Via this website, you can:
* Track & manage your pet's health, activity & safety
* Monitor their hourly and daily activities via Location Tracker and Activity Monitor
* Monitor their health even if you'r far away via Pulse and Temperature Monitor and even schedule an appointment with nearby vet.
